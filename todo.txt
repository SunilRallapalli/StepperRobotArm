- fast blinks 2 times in row on button press while mode is "follow".
-> set mode to "fastBlink" at the same place in code where we save the current
position to array.

- slower blinks while mode "replay" until replay has finished.
-> we can achieve this with blinkLED.update() and setting the mode to
"slowBlink" at the same place in code where the mode get's set to "replay"
